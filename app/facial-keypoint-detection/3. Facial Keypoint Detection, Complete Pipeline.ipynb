    "\n",
    "After you've trained a neural network to detect facial keypoints, you can then apply this network to *any* image that includes faces. The neural network expects a Tensor of a certain size as input and, so, to detect any face, you'll first have to do some pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detect all the faces in an image using a face detector (we'll be using a Haar Cascade detector in this notebook).\n",
    "2. Pre-process those face images so that they are grayscale, and transformed to a Tensor of the input size that your net expects. This step will be similar to the `data_transform` you created and applied in Notebook 2, whose job was tp rescale, normalize, and turn any iimage into a Tensor to be accepted as input to your CNN.\n",
    "3. Use your trained model to detect facial keypoints on the image.\n",
