## Computer Vision Facial Key Point Detection #
#### Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades on a trained CNN: This project uses computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face
